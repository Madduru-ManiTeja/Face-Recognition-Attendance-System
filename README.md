#Face Recognition Attendance System
This project is a Face Recognition Attendance System built using Python.
It leverages OpenCV for image processing, NumPy for numerical operations, and the face_recognition library for face detection and recognition.

Introduction
The Face Recognition Attendance System is designed to automate the process of marking attendance by recognizing faces in real-time. It is ideal for classrooms, offices, and other environments where attendance tracking is necessary.

Features:-
Real-time face detection and recognition
Easy integration with existing systems
High accuracy and speed
Simple and user-friendly interface

Requirements:-
Python 3.6+
OpenCV
NumPy
face_recognition

Installation:-
1)Clone the repository:
git clone repositorylink

2)Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3)Ensure you have a webcam connected

Usage
1)Prepare your dataset: Add images of the faces to be recognized in the dataset Training folder. Each person's images should be placed in a separate subfolder named after the person.
2)Run the facedetector.py 
3)The system will start capturing video from your webcam. It will detect and recognize faces in real-time, marking attendance automatically.
